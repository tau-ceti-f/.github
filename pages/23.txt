Take a walk

As soon as you enter the psychologist's room they ask "Want to take a walk? Been stuck in this room all day and I could use a change of scenery." You nod your head and follow out the room, through a door that can only be opened with a keycard. "Where are we going?" you ask. "There are a couple of greenhouses that give us the privacy and scenery that we need." You pass different labs which all have different people working in them. Each door requires the keycard, almost like Area 51. Although, you actually have no idea what Area 51 looks like from the inside or the outside for that matter. You make it to the greenhouse. Quite impressive! "I couldn't help but notice you circled Tau Ceti f on your list of destinations and crossed out some others. Why did you do that?" You look at the books you are holding with the list of destinations on top. You can't flip it around now as that would look suspicious. "If win the selection that would be my first choice because I read somewhere that it is the most potentially habitable." You are unsure about your choice of words, is it really winning? "Why do you think you deserve to go to Tau Ceti f over all the others?" they poke for a reaction. This is your time to be politically correct. "It is not like I think deserve it or that Tau Ceti f belongs to me. If I win (for lack of a better word!) I would get first choice, those are the rules." "And what do you hope to find on Tau Ceti f?". Do you tell them? "Let me turn this around, what does Space Origin hope to find on Tau Ceti f?". They chuckle, "Nice try, we're talking about you here." Looks like you're going to have to answer. "I hope to venture into the unknown and maybe discover a new civilization.". "That is certainly a possibility." they respond. Pfew!
