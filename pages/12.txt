Run for your life

Beep beep beep! Halfway, time to speed up. You have already overtaken some people a lap but they could be from other groups too. The beeps would come back one last time when there are 3 and 1 minutes left. You look at the tracker. It reads 1196 meters. Your goal is 2800 but you’d be more than happy with 2600 too. If you keep up the pace now 2600 seems reachable. You can feel your legs starting to tire lap after lap. Beep... Beep... Beep... that must be the three minutes marker. You look at the tracker 1863 meters. Your heart is beating in your throat, 205 the tracker says. That can’t be sustainable. You have to. You cannot be one of the people that get kicked out after the first round. You clench your palms and speed up the pace. Those three minutes seem awfully long. The device starts beeping faster. One more minute. You look at then tracker. 2178 meters. It feels like your heart is bursting out of your chest. Every breath you take hurts like hell. Ok. Calm your breathing. One more minute. Finally, the beeping turns into one constant beep. 2394 meters. The number is not increasing anymore. You're slightly dissatisfied but you are so out of breath that all you can do is drop to the floor. A scientist marks down something on their iPad in the distance. You close your eyes and take in big gulps of air with every breath. Your score ain’t gonna get better than this you think. Not today.
