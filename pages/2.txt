In the distance

After hours of nothing you finally see something in the distance. Or so you think. Time to take a closer look. Yes. That is definitely something. But whatever it is you cannot make out yet. Your eyes need to adjust to the vast darkness. If only your eyes could focus on one point in particular, letting just the light for the tiny spec in the distance fall on your retina. The spec disappears as you try to look at it more closely. Probably because the fovea centralis mostly contains photoreceptor cone cells that need more light to be activated. It could also have been your imagination. The mind starts playing nasty tricks when deprived of stimulation and contact. How long has it been? 13 years feels about right but without a day-night cycle to go off of it's more of an educated guess than a truth.
