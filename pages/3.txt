Out the window

You look out the window and see it clearly now. Maybe pressing your nose up to the window wasn't the best strategy to see into the abyss. Could it be? If only those stupid engineers built in a way to dim the light system in the vessel. The way it works is clever through - harnessing the residual glow from spent plutonium rods and passing it through a network of glass fiber cables - but a dimmer would have been nice. Guess they figured that you don't really need to see outside as much as inside and a dimmer would have needed power to operate. You are under strict instructions not to turn on the the main systems until you are in reach of Tau Ceti's gravitational pull, something about preserving energy for de-orbiting.
