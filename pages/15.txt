Results time

The scientist is carrying a long list of scores. Without saying anything they stick the list on the wall and are gone before you could even blink your eyes. Everyone swarms that one list in anticipation for their results. There is a wide range of reactions, sighs of relief, people storming out the room, and even someone starting to cry. Now that you think of it already some people seem to be gone. It definitely is not the 100+ people that started this morning. Maybe they couldn’t complete the Cooper test? You make your way through the crowd to look at the scores. You don’t see your name yet in the first ten entries. You see the name Aidan first on the list. The stupidest way to spell Aiden you think to your self. Your eyes travel down the list. You’re not part of the next ten either and your heart starts to drop. Finally you find your name. Number 28, just a few spots above the big red line. That must mean you made it! Adrenaline rushes through your veins. 89th percentile for mental and 67th for physical. That puts you on spot 28. Not great but at least that means you pass on to the next round. If it wasn’t for the mental test you’d be out for sure.
