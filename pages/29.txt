Cartridge

The end of the three months are coming up and everybody was a little more on edge than usual. It was just the same personalities but then a little more blown up. Logan couldn't sit still anymore. It was almost restless leg on steroids. Kai just couldn't stop talking. Emmerson seemed fine though. Does they know something that you don't? One more week and then you would either have to go home or go on to the end of this thing. You wonder what would happen if they sent you home. Would that just be it? How would you even live out the rest of your days? That could be insufferably long because ever since they discovered the reversal for telomere shortening and cancer was eradicated people lived longer than ever before. Nowadays, people are more likely to get killed in a mugging or get hit by a bus than die of old age. Maybe you getting hit by a bus wasn't a bad way to go if you didn't advance. You hold onto a cartridge. Pink was their favorite color. Every time you would leave the house you'd take Leila with you. "Together forever" were the words you spoke out so confidently during your ceremony. You know you're doing this for Leila and that failing means the end.
