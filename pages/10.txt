Back to school

It really feels like that. Going back to school. Probably because they hosted the first phase of the selection in an actual school. They aren't even going to pay you until you pass the first round. You guess because too many people applied. Is everyone so sick of living on Earth? You have your reasons but what about the other 100+ people? You walk up to the unimpressive school that looks deserted. Makes sense because it is a Sunday. Getting through the first part shouldn’t pose a problem, the Cooper test for physical ability and a standardized IQ test for mental ability. You’re not the athletic type but you aren’t overweight either, unlike some people here... Weird choice you think to yourself, the Cooper test. It is really starting to feel like PE class now. Guess the more specific tests such as the 30-movement agility test come later. For some reason thinking that out loud feels like a pat on the back. Like you did your homework while the rest of these suckers failed.
