Drained

Mentally and physically. You can already see the sun setting out the window. What a long day it has been. You’re anxious for the results as this will govern your future. If you are in the top 30 percent you’ll advance to the next stage. You wonder how long this is going to take. Then again, if you pass you don’t get to go home anyway. Training starts tomorrow. The first launch is scheduled for exactly ten years from now with the following twelve launches being in the following months. Room, board and a decent salary will be provided during the training if you pass this stage. If your name is on the list you’d be safe for at least three months. That’s when the next culling will happen. You feel confident but somehow you are also doubting yourself. You look around the room and see some pretty athletic and smart-looking people. Maybe what you have isn’t enough. Just as you start spiraling a scientist walks into the waiting room.
