Top down driving

The rest of the day was rather uneventful. Together with Kai, Logan and Emmerson, you borrowed a Jeep to go into town for the day. Just to get away from all this and just have a moment to talk about the last few days. The wind blows through your hair as the Jeep makes its way down the dirt road back to the civilized world. You wonder if you should tell the others what went down in the wet room. Maybe if it comes up, but you decide not to lead with it. So much other stuff to unpack. Let's talk about the competition. There seems to have formed four different camps with some loners and some swingers here and there. You have Aidan's gang. Felicity's group is a strong number two. Then you have the whiz kids (even though they are all probably well into adulthood) and your group. Two groups with brains, two groups with brawls. Logan mentioned that during their psych sessions they were told that they probably would not make it. You respond by assuring him that maybe they are just trying to rile you up. See if they can get a reaction. You say this to cheer him but but deep down you have a feeling it is not going to end well for Logan.
