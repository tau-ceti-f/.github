Diner

Lunch isn't something to write home about either. Some prisoners probably get better food than you got on your plate right now. Brown soup, a few slices of bread and something that can only be described as spam covered in lasagna sheets. Most of the people sit alone at their tables. You figure that if you're going to make it to the end of this thing you're going to need allies. Maybe one or two, not more. The last thing you want is to be stabbed in the back close to the finish line. You scout the room for a potential target. One of the tables in the back. You remember him from the sleeping quarters. Think they have the bunk below yours. You take the chair opposite to them. Somehow the name Emmerson rings a bell. They nod their head and continue eating. Seventh on the list if you remember correctly. Perfect. Not the top 5 because they have targets on their back but not far down the list either. Unlike you though... Do they know who you are? You just start talking to fill the void between the two of you. You talk about the whole living situation and the lack of privacy. Speaking of privacy. Emmerson believes they monitor your every move and weigh that into the evaluation. It makes sense but is also a little creepy.
