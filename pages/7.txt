Familiar warmth

Waking up in the morning was your time of day. Especially on the weekends. Leila would already be up. The smell of eggs, bacon and freshly ground coffee. The day was already great and it hadn't even started. Why give all of that up? Where are you going? That answer is simple. But where are you going with your life? Looking back you wonder how your life events could have lead you to take on this impossible task. Why did you have to volunteer? You maybe had some people fooled with that talk of patriotism but you and I both know that wasn't it. Was there really nothing left for you on earth? Leila is still out there but you know she would support you no matter what you decide. It had to be a human to take this venture because there is a very real chance that the AI in our bionics would not be able to adapt to a new environment quick enough. But why you? The answer scares you a little. Not knowing never sat well with you. Already in high school you would rather look up obscure quantum theories rather than do your math homework. The fact is, we don't know what is out there and there is only one way to find out. That is the thought that keeps you up at night.
