Space 101

The first class covered everything regarding the mission. The way they layed it down it sounds quite simple. Travel to the exoplanet. Find a way to communicate. Wait until a first colony arrives. Easy peasy. The class will briefly go over each aspect of the mission. First the travel part. Space Origin has designed a spacecraft that will travel at near-lightspeed and that initial tests with an unmanned prototype have so far been successful. You'll be alone on the ship as it is space-constricted. There is a question from the group. "What do we do all those years in there if the ship is so small?". Cryo sleep. That is a new topic for you. You sit up straight to listen more carefully. In short: you sleep, they cool you down to minus 328 degrees so your cells don't die off, you wake up about a year later and repeat the processes until you reach your destination. Thinking about this puts you on edge. So many things can go wrong. How many things are going to wrong? How many of the thirteen will eventually reach their exoplanet? What happens after you arrive is even more uncertain. Basically you have zero chance of a happy ending... Unless there is already a civilization out there. They must have considered that possibility, right? You decide to pay attention again. They're already on the part about finding a way to communicate. There will be several classes on types of communication that would be possible over long distances in vacuum. If they don't hear back from us within reasonable (funny!) time they assume the planet to be uninhabitable.
