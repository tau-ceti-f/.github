After the fact

That and the other thing that you’d rather not speak of. Why is it always that your mind knows it doesn’t want to go somewhere but still does? Here we go... You relive the events. The police at the door, the hospital, the nightmare that you couldn’t seem to wake up from, the letter in the mail and the half-existence you and Leila lived after that. The letter said it would be just like before but it was far from that. The technology is impressive but nothing beats the feeling of skin-on-skin. You just cannot fake that with technology. They tried their best to not make it uncanny but there is not faking the real thing. But for some reason you also cannot seem to get rid of it. Since then your views on playing god, as skeptics call it, have shifted dramatically. You’re still waiting for what once was, knowing it will never come. It pains you to say this but your only hope lies in more advanced technology because giving up is not an option.
