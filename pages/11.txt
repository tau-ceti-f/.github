PE class

They had the group split up in batches. When your tracker starts beeping you are allowed to start. Not too fast at first. When the tracker beeps again you’ll know you’re halfway and you can start speeding up. The tricks is not starting too fast because once you have to walk because you can’t run anymore it is over. They said the tracker also measures heartrate and blood oxigination. Probably because reaching 3k but dying while doing it is not great for your score. You see the people in your group do warmup exercises and wonder if you should do something too. You jump up and down a few times as high as you can. You have no idea what you are doing but saw athletes on tv do it. Beep beep beep beep! Your group starts their 12 minutes. A few participants spurt ahead of the group. Their loss. Focus on your own game!
