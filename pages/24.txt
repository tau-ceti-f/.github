Holding the line

The weekends are free, apart from a little physical conditioning in the mornings. Today was a 2k run around the complex. You never realized how grandiose the whole complex is. You could easily do a 10k here. After the run, or any physical activity for that matter, there is always a rush for the showers. There just aren't enough showers for the amount of people here so you never have time to enjoy the warm water running down your skin. You queue up for the showers holding your towel and a fresh change of clothes. Six people in front of you, looks like you made it before rush hour. You hear some hustling behind you in the line and turn to see what is going on. A group of five people seem to want to cut the line, Aidan and Kendall being among them. Some people are protesting but none of them dare to interfere. They pass you and head in the showers. "Out!" you hear one of them shout. "I said out!" A few seconds later about seven people walk out, defeated. Some still have soap in their hair. "Fuck this, I'm going home" you hear one of them say. You can feel your blood starting to boil. If there is one thing you can't stand it is entitled behavior. Do you say something? It's five agains one. Your clique is not here but you're unsure if they are even brave enough to stand by you anyway. Seven came out, only five went in. You could just head in and use one of the unused showers. Show them you are no pushover. You ask the few in front of you "Can I?". No objections.
