Sound logic

One of you favorite exercises is the dropping. The first time it happened you had no idea what was going on. A drill sergeant stormed in in the middle of the night and shouted "You have 5 minutes to get ready!" Each one of you got blindfolded and put in a van that took you to an undisclosed location. Everyone was dropped off alone at a different location, without any equipment or even a change of clothes. All you had the tracker watch but the screen was always unresponsive. You had six hours to get back to the complex or they would come pick you up and fail you. Six hours gives you time to travel about 25k. You figure they put in some margin so you'd be about 20k away from the complex. After the first time you figured out that if they dropped everyone at around the same distance from the complex the vans had to drive part of a circle. Your best chance is to start walking perpendicular to the direction the van was traveling in. Only challenge would be to figure out if the van is traveling clockwise or counter clockwise. You figured out a relatively reliable way by walking back along the tracks of the van first for about one kilometer and count the amount of left and right turns. The latter few times you even tried to deduce the movement of the van while in it but with the blindfold it was almost impossible. With your newfound knowledge you consistently placed top three.
