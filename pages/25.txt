Wet room

You slowly make your way into the room, the eyes of the others in the line following your every move. You hang up your fresh cloths, strip down and confidently head to one of the free showers. As soon as you turn the tap on they notice your presence. They almost seem unsure what to do, each looking at the others. You just start your shower routine like nothing is wrong but you're are anxious on the inside. "Do you mind?" Aidan asks nicely but you understand they meant you should bugger off. "You aren't using this shower. What's the harm?" "Says who we aren't using it?" another one chimes in "Yeah says who?". You look them up and down in their primal form, unimpressed. Without clothes, curves turn into rolls, certain elements loose their allure and other things seem a lot smaller. You might have even let out a slight chuckle. "You think we're joking?". Aidan struts over to you and gets up real close. "Listen closely..." Before he could get any closer you push him away. Bad move. He recovers and puts you in a choke hold agains the wall. Your legs flailing. Can't breath. You struggle but Aidan is stronger. You can feel the last oxygen leaving your brain. "Aidan! Leave him!" you hear Kendall shout, "not worth it." You drop to the floor, gasping for air. All you want is to run away but you can't. You'll never get anybody's respect if you do. You caress your neck. That's going to leave a bruise. As the five prepare to leave you collect yourself. The others can't see you like this. Once gone the group is gone, some others dare to come in. "Don't know what you did but last time they were in the showers for half an hour." You brush it off like it was nothing. "It's not like they own the place." you muster up, still course from the encounter.
