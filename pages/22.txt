Dilating time

Class today is given by a scientist who looks like they got stuck in the 80s. Even has one of those phone holders that you click to your belt. "Very simply put. On the SP1 (you guess that is the name of the spacecraft?) you'll have a velocity near the speed of light. The closer you get to the speed of light. The slower you'll perceive time. Let's take an example. It takes about five years to travel to Proxima Centauri b, that is five years for you. Because of time dilation it would be thirteen 'earth-years' before you arrive." You covered time dilation in college so this is just a refresher for you. Tau Ceti f is about twelve lightyears away. You take thirteen years for your calculation. Speed of light is about three hundred million meters per second so you take 275 as velocity, just to be conservative. That makes the relative time about 32 years. Just for fun you do the calculation for Gliese 625 b and come to a relative time of 60 years. Ha, sucks for whoever has to go there. If you factor in the time for the communication to reach earth you deem the Gliese 625 b mission to be impossible. In fact, any planet further than thirteen lightyears is a stretch. You look at your list and cross of the last four planets. "So far so good?" the scientist checks with the audience. Let's dive into the physics behind this phenomenon. This is going to a long and boring lecture.
