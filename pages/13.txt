Exam time

This is your domain. Written comprehension, visual spatial thinking, fluid reasoning, memory, and logical thinking. Again you wonder what this has to do with space travel but conclude that it is probably just a fast way to weed out the weak. If you can’t solve some simple puzzles how can we expect that you can reinstall an oxygen hose, or whatever it is that you have to do in a space emergency. You open the booklet and start with the first part. You've got half an hour for this part and then you’ll get another booklet. You zoom through all the questions even finishing before the 30 minutes are done. The next four parts don’t pose a challenge for you at all. The two and a half hours pass by in a flash. You hand in your final booklet. That’s it. You’re done. This could be the end. The thought makes you uneasy because you’d be lost without this. Back to your nine-to-five with no outlook on a better future, a better Leila.
