Here comes the cold

Now is not the time to take it slow. Quickly, you hurry to open the hatch to the cryo chamber. If you don't make it before you doze off your cells will use up the available nutrients and oxygen too quickly and die off before you would even wake up. The thought of dying in your sleep is unsettling. What would it feel like? Would you even know? You shake the thought out of your mind and buckle yourself up in the chamber. This might be your last time entering cryo sleep. Tau Ceti f is just under 12 lightyears away and this is the 13th time you enter cryo sleep. If your heavy-eyed math skills don't fail you, it means you must be getting close. Super-lightspeed travel hasn't been proven possible and probably never will. You feel the cyro chamber locking and the temperature dropping. You can hardly move your fingers and toes anymore. Here we go again.
