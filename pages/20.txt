Drilling

The afternoons are for physical training. Every. Single. Day. The thought of it already exhausts you. You figure this also gives you a chance to scope out the competition. See what you're up against. You can't help but wonder about the evaluation criteria. Is it going to be 50/50 like before? What about the psych evaluations then? Not knowing means you have to give every part 100 percent. Stop that thought. You're already thinking of cutting corners? It's a simple circuit training today. Some of these people here definitely look like athletes. The drill sergeant blows his whistle and everyone starts with their exercises. Push ups for you. Pull ups. Dribble. Box jumps. This is definitely going to be a struggle. 30 minutes in and you're already doubting whether you can keep this up for ten years. Maybe it will get easier? You look at the others and are relieved to see some also struggling. You see Aidan breezing through it though. For Emmerson it looks like a walk in the park too. You realize that you really do not know most of these people, not even their names. Maybe you should start making an effort. Dinner and the little free time you get after that would be perfect for that.
