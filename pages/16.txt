Bunked up

One full bus of participants, that is how many people passed the first round, probably just under 40. Everyone just keeps to themselves. You're seated next to a woman, short hair, slouched down. They just look out the window. You just stare straight ahead. Why is this so awkward? The rest of the ride is very uneventful. The bus pulls into a hangar where a scientist is waiting for you. They escort the group through a bleak looking hall. You are under strict instructions to stay together. You figure this would be one way to sneak into the Space Origin complex to do some corporate espionage. The group is lead into the living quarters which is just an empty room with bunks lined on the walls. The scientist takes roll to make sure everyone is here before leaving, locking the door behind them. You wouldn't call this a warm welcome. Science, not vacation you recall. Guess it is time to pick your bunk now. Top or bottom? Your indecisiveness might have decided for you as other people have already claimed most of the bottom bunks. You pick a top bunk in the corner because that way you'll only have one neighbor. Probably won't differ that much but it makes you feel better anyway. At least the bunks have little curtains that give you the illusion of privacy. You hop in your bunk, throw your bag agains in the corner and almost immediately pass out.
