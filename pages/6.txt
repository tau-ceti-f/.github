Flare?!

It's a struggle now to keep your eyes open. Any moment now you feel yourself giving in to the impending darkness. Your eyes close up and you feel the warmth of sleep setting in. But then all of a sudden something happens. A flash so bright you can see the red glow through your eyelids. Your eyes jump wide open. Is this supposed to be happening? Just a second ago the bright light wasn't there. Is this even possible? You search your mind for theories as to where the bright light could come from. A supernova? Well you would need a star for that first. Is it a star then? Seems unlikely too. Your mind jumps to a final theory but you don't dare to think it out loud. Is sleep playing tricks on you? You struggle to stay awake but the light remains imminent. Nothing you have learned in your ten years of training could explain what is happening right now. The easy explanation that it is your mind fooling you becomes more likely and likely. If this is just happening in your head there is nothing out there and nothing to worry about. You close your eyes a last time time. Dozing off into the deep cryo sleep.
