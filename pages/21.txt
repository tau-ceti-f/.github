Checking it twice

You make three lists in your notebook. On the first list you put Emmerson, Kai, and Logan. The four of you sort of formed a group during dinner. Then on the list of competitors you put Kendall, a young individual you got partnered up with during physical who sort of gave you bitchy vibes. Of course you put Aidan there too. You want to start with your third list, but are interrupted by a soft sound. Moaning? Crying? Could be either. You put on your headphones to drown out the sounds and focus on your lists. While going over the other participants you realize you are actually pretty curious as to where the sounds are coming from. You remove one of the sides of your headphones. Yep. The sound is still there. Whoever it is, they are definitely trying to keep their actions hidden. It must be one of of the bunks closer to you then. You try to recall the owners of the bunks closest to you, Quinn, Drew, Tori and Emmerson. You haven't talked to the person diagonally below you yet. The whimpering seems to intensify to a groan. You listen carefully and can also make out some sort of ticking or clicking. You wonder why, a little revolted but also captivated. All you want to know is who it is but you can't just step out of your pod to have a look. The sound comes to a sudden halt, releasing the tension. You wonder if other people heard this too. They must have, right? You think that the offender probably through that everyone was sleeping already. You leave it for what it is and decide to take your slumber too.
