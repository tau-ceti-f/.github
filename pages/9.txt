Breakthrough

There was a time where you didn’t even want to get out of bed in the morning. That was until you heard on the news that Space Origin was starting missions to potentially inhabitable exoplanets. That means those planets could potentially have extraterrestrial civilizations. They had made a breakthrough in utilizing gravitational assist to reaching near-lightspeed travel or something like that. It didn’t matter to you. It just meant there was hope. Space Origin is recruiting thirteen travellers who would go to thirteen different planets. You figure you'd be able to pass the theoretical component of the recruitment with ease, the physical part probably not so. From what you hear on tv it sounds more like a long selection process than a recruitment though. You see the list of destinations. First in the selection means first pick in destination. Gliese 1061 c and Gliese 1061 d are both on the list. Would that mean you go together with someone else in one spacecraft or go separate at different times? Not going alone sounds comforting but then again what if they are insufferable? Tau Ceti f. That is the one. You recall science deemed it the most potentially habitable exoplanet a while back. That would give you the highest chance there is at finding an advanced civilization out there. Proxima Centauri b would be an ok-ish choice just because it is by far the closest. The other options seem like long shots (literally!). If you were to do this you would need to be first in class so no one could take Tau Ceti f away from you.
