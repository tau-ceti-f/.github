Routine

Class in the morning. Physical in the afternoon. Every week was the same. You decided from now on you'll take your showers after dinner, after the rush. You stay clear of them and just stick to your own little group. Try to not get into any more trouble. There is the occasional team challenge where the cliques get mixed. If they're not all together some of them are even tolerable and capable team members. If it wasn't for their egos you can almost see how they got selected in the first place. The weekly class on following order, as you dubbed it, is your least favorite. They just make you do things for the sake of following the orders of a superior. This week you for example had to pitch a big tent, only to have to take it down again and move it over twenty feet to the right. Just removing the pegs and and moving the tent was not allowed, even though it would have been perfectly possible because there is literally no wind. There were some exercises that were bearable. Shooting guns for example. There was just something about it. Almost like you are holding pure power. Before you were allowed to fire your first round you had to be able to disassemble and reassemble your gun within one minute. So predictable.
