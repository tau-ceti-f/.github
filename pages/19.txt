Psych

The first room in this complex that feels somewhat homey. A stark difference from all the exposed concrete and bare hallways. A library of sorts. Although from your position you can't read the script on the books. Are they even real books or just props? The psychologist is exactly what you would expect from a therapist, calm, collected and somehow also wise. "Let's start with a simple question. How do you feel about failing?". A simple question? There are so many nuances here that could make or break your case with the psychologist. They'll be the one to either give a thumbs up or thumbs down when it comes to judgement day. The first thought that pops into your head is that failing is not an option. You almost blurt it out but hold yourself at the last possible moment. Quick. Think of a politically correct answer. "You know.." to give yourself some more time to formulate your answer. "Failing is part of life. What really matters is how you recover from it" you respond, happy with your answer. You poll for a reaction but your counterpart does not move an inch. "And what do you do when you fail?" they continue poking for an answer. Great... You explain your first reaction to be to try to fix your mistakes where possible. When the fire is extinguished you can calmly recollect the events and analyze where it went wrong. Do you really think she can't see through your bullshit answers? Guess we'll find out at some point.
